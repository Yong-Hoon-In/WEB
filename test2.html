            is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> 
            and web applications.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or fr
            om local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the 
            structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appe
            arance of the document.

                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
                 dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted pr
                 ogramming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three 
                 core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make 
                 webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. Th
                 e majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it wi
                 thout the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each 
                 of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of Java
                 Script, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not su
                 pporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional featur
                 es beyond ECMA.
